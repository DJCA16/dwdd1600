    <p>This page, you can read over some of the basic rules of <a href="rules.html#soccer">Soccer</a>, <a href="rules.html#basketball">Basketball</a>, Football, Baseball and Golf</p>
    <h2 id="soccer">Rules of Soccer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A soccer game starts with a coin toss. The captain of the away team calls heads or tails, and the winning captain gets to choose whether their team will take the first kickoff. In the second half, the kickoff is taken by the side that did not take it in the first.</li>
        <li>Each team consists of 11 soccer players, one of which is the goalkeeper. A game is split into two 45-minute halves, with a break in between for halftime. However, games are often shorter at the youth soccer level.</li>
        <li>The aim of the game is to score goals by getting the ball into the other team’s net. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins.</li>
        <li>Players can score a goal from anywhere on the field, but there are some specific rules. For example, a goal cannot be scored from an indirect free kick.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>During the Kickoff:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>All players (except the player taking the kickoff) must be in their half of the field</li>
        <li>The ball must be stationary on the center spot</li>
        <li>The kicker taking the kickoff must not touch the ball again until another player touches it</li>
        <li>The opponents of the team taking the kickoff must be at least 9.15 meters (10 yards) away from the ball</li>
        <li>The ball is considered "in play" when it is kicked and moves</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Other Basic Rules:</strong></p>
    <dl>
        <dt>No Hands:</dt>
        <dd>The goalkeeper (goalie) is the only player on the field who can use their hands. All other players must use their feet, head, or chest to control the ball. If the player touches the ball, it’s considered a handball and a foul.</dd>
        <dt>Throw-ins:</dt>
        <dd>When the ball goes out of bounds on the sidelines, the team who didn’t touch it last gets to throw the ball back into play.</dd>
        <dt>Goal Kicks and Corner Kicks:</dt>
        <dd>When the ball goes out of bounds behind the goal line (not resulting in a goal), the goalkeeper of the team who didn’t touch it last gets to kick the ball back into play. If the ball goes out of bounds on the sideline in front of the goal, the team who didn’t touch it last gets a corner kick.</dd>
        <dt>Direct and inderect Kicks:</dt>
        <dd>Players can score on a direct kick, which is a kick that goes directly into the goal without another player touching it. An indirect kick is when another player must touch the ball before it can go into the goal.</dd>
        <dt>No Time Limit for Possesion:</dt>
        <dd>There is no time limit on how long a team can keep the ball.</dd>
        <dt>The Clock Doesn't Stop:</dt>
        <dd>The game clock does not stop, even if the ball goes out of bounds or there is an injury.</dd>
        <dt>Stoppage Time:</dt>
        <dd>If the referee deems it necessary, he may add extra time at the end of each half. This is called stoppage time or injury time.</dd>
        <dt>Offside Rule:</dt>
        <dd>The offside rule is one of the most misunderstood rules in soccer. The basic idea is that a player cannot be in an advantageous position when the ball is played to them. Being in an offside position is not in itself an offense. An offside offense occurs when a player is in the opponent’s half of the field and closer to their goal than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><strong>Layout of the Field:</strong></p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Boundary Lines:</dt>
        <dd>The outer lines of the rectangular shape of the soccer pitch are called boundary lines. Referees use these lines to determine if the soccer ball or player has gone out of bounds</dd>
        <dt>Touchlines:</dt>
        <dd>These lines run the entire length of the field and demarcate the playing area. They are the longer lines on the pitch's rectangular shape and are often called the sidelines.</dd>
        <dt>End Lines:</dt>
        <dd>Also known as bylines, the end lines run along the short end of the soccer pitch.</dd>
        <dt>Goal Lines:</dt>
        <dd>These lines are located at each end of the field and mark the goal areas.</dd>
        <dt>Center Line:</dt>
        <dd>This line divides the field in half.</dd>
        <dt>Corner Arcs:</dt>
        <dd>These curved lines mark the corners of the field.</dd>
        <dt>Center Circle:</dt>
        <dd>This circle has a 10-yard radius and is located at the center of the field.</dd>
        <dt>Penalty Area:</dt>
        <dd>The penalty area is located centrally between the corner arcs and is a large rectangular area on each end side of the field. It is 18 yards long and 36 yards wide, sometimes called "the 18."</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><strong>Rules Regarding Play on the Field:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>When the ball crosses over the boundary lines, it is out of bounds. Play is temporarily stopped (though the clock keeps running) and the referee will determine which team gets possession.</li>
        <li>When the ball goes out of play, the corner kick, goal kick, or throw-in is awarded to the opposing team (depending on which part of the field the ball went over).</li>
        <li>A throw-in is awarded when the soccer ball crosses the touchline. The player must throw the ball using both hands with both feet on the ground, and the opposing team must be at least 10 yards away from where the throw-in will land.</li>
        <li>The corner kick or goal kick is awarded when the ball crosses over the end line, having last been touched by the defending team.</li>
        <li>The last team to touch the soccer ball before it goes out of bounds is usually the team that awards the other team the restart.</li>
        <li>A goal can only be scored if the entire ball crosses over the goal line, between the goal posts, and under the crossbar.</li>
        <li>If the ball hits either of the side posts or goes under the crossbar but doesn’t completely cross the goal line, it is not a goal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Rules Regarding Teams and Players:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are rules regarding the number of players. According to the International Football Association Board (IFAB), a soccer game is played by two teams, each with a maximum of eleven players. There must be a minimum of at least seven players to start or continue playing a match. One of the players must play as the goalkeeper.</li>
        <li>The number of substitutions can vary depending on the level of play. The FA states that the maximum number of substitutions for competition play is five. However, accommodations and modifications are often made for youth soccer. During the COVID pandemic, FIFA and the FA made the change from a maximum of three substitutions to five; it is now a permanent part of the laws of the game. However, it is up to each league to determine whether they will use the new rule.</li>
        <li>Many competition rules also state that all players and substitutes must be named on the team sheet before the kickoff (start of play). The team sheet is a list of all the players that will be participating in the match, as well as any potential substitutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Basic Soccer Formations:</strong></p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Teams can line up in any formation that the coach finds to naturally fit the team but some of the most common formations are:</dt>
        <dd>4-4-2: This is probably the most popular formation in soccer. It consists of four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards or strikers. The two forwards act as the main offensive players, with eight defending players. This is a great formation for gaining possession of the ball from opposing players and changing the direction of play.</dd>
        <dd>4-3-3: This formation consists of four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards. Because there is a large number of attacking players, this is a powerful formation if your team is looking for passing opportunities, breakaways, and chances to get to the other team’s goal.</dd>
        <dd>3-5-2: This formation is composed of three defenders, five midfielders (two of which are wingbacks), and two forwards. This is a great formation if your team wants to keep possession of the ball and control the game.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><strong>Rules Regarding Fouls and Penalties:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Penalties are up to the referee's discretion and can be given for a variety of reasons. The most common reason is for a player to commit a reckless or violent act against another player.</li>
        <li>For minor offenses, a penalty kick or free kick may be awarded to the opposing team.</li>
        <li>The penalty spot is 12 yards from the middle of the goal line. This is where a player takes the penalty kick.</li>
        <li>The opposing team may be awarded a direct free kick for more serious offenses. The offending player may also be given a yellow or red card.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-12---fouls-and-misconduct" target="_blank">According to the FA,</a> the following actions will result in a foul and a free kick will be awarded to the opposing team:</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>    
        <li>Tripping</li>
        <li>Pushing</li>
        <li>Holding an opponent</li>
        <li>Hitting</li>
        <li>Kicking</li>
        <li>Spitting on an opponent</li>
        <li>Tackling from behind</li>
        <li>Charging into an opponent</li>
        <li>Touching the ball with your hands (if you aren't the goalkeeper)</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>     
        <li>Rules that Apply to the Goalkeeper:</li>
    </ul>    
    <ol>
        <li>Take control of the ball with their hands away from the penalty box</li>
        <li>Hold the ball more than 6 seconds</li>
        <li>Touch the ball with their hands after a teammate purposefully kicks it to them</li>
        <li>Touch the ball with their hands directly after a throw-in by a teammate</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Penalty Card Colors Explained:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A yellow card is shown to a player as a warning or caution. Two yellow cards in one game lead to a red card, and the player must leave the field.</li>
        <li>A red card is given to a player who has committed a serious offense or accumulated two yellow cards. The player must leave the field and can't be replaced for the rest of the game.</li>
        <li>The referee can choose to give a yellow card to a player for the following actions:</li>
    </ul>    
    <ol>
        <li>Excessive Fouls</li>
        <li>Unsportsmanlike Behavior</li>
        <li>Dissent by word or action</li>
        <li>Delaying the game</li>
        <li>Failing to respect the required distance on a free kick</li>
        <li>Entering or reentering the field of play without the referee's permission</li>
        <li>Leaving the playing field on purpose without the referee's approval</li>
        <li>Arguing with the referee</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The referee also has the power to give a player a red card, kicking them out of the game, for the following actions:</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Serious foul play</li>
        <li>Violent conduct</li>
        <li>Using offensive, insulting, or abusive language</li>
        <li>Receiving a second yellow card in one game</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Rules Regarding Equipment:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>According to <a href="https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-4---the-players-equipment" target="_blank">Law 4 of the Laws of the Game,</a> there are four main principles regarding players' equipment:</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Safety is essential. The players can’t wear anything dangerous and must remove all jewelry.</li>
        <li>A player’s compulsory equipment consists of a shirt with sleeves, shorts, socks, shin guards, and appropriate footwear.</li>
        <li>Colors distinguish teams. Each team needs to wear colors that distinguish them from each other. Goalkeepers must also wear colors that are distinguishable from the other players on the team.</li>
        <li>There are also rules for other equipment and head covers. Non-dangerous proactive equipment (like facemasks) is permitted. Goalkeepers can also wear caps. Sports spectacles are also allowed. Head covers must be black or the same color as the shirt, not attached to the shirt, and not dangerous to other players.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="basketball">Rules of Basketball</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The rules of basketball can vary slightly depending on the level of play (for example professional rules differ from college rules) or where the game is played (international rules are different from USA professional rules). These rule differences, however, are usually just variations on the basic game of basketball and the majority of the rules discussed below can be applied to most any game of basketball played.</li>
        <li>Two teams of five players each try to score by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground.</li>
        <li>The game is played on a rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end.</li>
        <li>The court is divided into two main sections by the mid-court line.</li>
        <li><em>If the offensive team puts the ball into play behind the mid-court line, it has ten seconds (or 8 second in the NBA) to get the ball over the mid-court line. If it doesn't, then the defense gets the ball.</em></li>
        <li>Once the offensive team gets the ball over the mid-court line, it can no longer have possession of the ball in the area behind the midcourt line. If it does, the defense is awarded the ball.</li>
        <li>The ball is moved down the court toward the basket by passing or dribbling. The team with the ball is called the offense. The team without the ball is called the defense. The defense tries to steal the ball, contest shots, deflect passes, and garner rebounds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>When a team makes a basket, they score two points and the ball goes to the other team.</li>
        <li>If a basket, or field goal, is made outside of the three-point arc, then that basket is worth three points. A free throw is worth one point.</li>
        <li>Free throws are awarded to a team according to some formats involving the number of fouls committed in a half and/or the type of foul committed.</li>
        <li>Fouling a shooter always results in two or three free throws being awarded the shooter, depending upon where he was when he shot. If he was beyond the three-point line, then he gets three shots.</li>
        <li><em>Other types of fouls do not result in free throws being awarded until a certain number have accumulated during a half (called “team fouls”).</em></li>
        <li>Once that number is reached, then the player who was fouled is awarded a '1-and-1' opportunity. If he makes his first free throw, he gets to attempt a second. If he misses the first shot, the ball is live on the rebound.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Game Clock:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each game is divided into sections, and all levels have two halves.</li>
        <li>In college, each half is twenty minutes long.</li>
        <li>In high school and below, the halves are divided into eight (and sometimes, six) minute quarters. In the pros, quarters are twelve minutes long.</li>
        <li>There is a gap of several minutes between halves. Gaps between quarters are relatively short.</li>
        <li><em>If the score is tied at the end of regulation, then overtime periods of various lengths are played until a winner emerges.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Basket Assignment and Tip-Off:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each team is assigned a basket or goal to defend.</li>
        <li>This means that the other basket is their scoring basket.</li>
        <li>At halftime, the teams switch baskets.</li>
        <li>The game begins with one player from either team at center court.</li>
        <li>A referee will toss the ball up between the two. The player that gets his hands on the ball will tip it to a teammate. This is called a tip-off.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Fouls and Violations:</strong></p>
    <dl>
        <dt>In addition to stealing the ball from an opposing player, there are other ways for a team to get the ball.</dt>
        <dt>One such way is if the other team commits a foul or violation.</dt>
        <dt><em>Fouls:</em></dt>
        <dt>Personal fouls:</dt>
        <dd>Personal fouls include any type of illegal physical contact including:</dd>
    </dl>
    <ul>
        <li>Hitting</li>
        <li>Pushing</li>
        <li>Slapping</li>
        <li>Holding</li>
        <li>Illegal pick/screen -- when an offensive player is moving. When an offensive player sticks out a limb and makes physical contact with a defender in an attempt to block the path of the defender.</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
        <dt>Personal foul penalties:</dt>
        <dd>If a player is shooting while a being fouled, then he gets two free throws if his shot doesn't go in, but only one free throw if his shot does go in.</dd>
    </dl>
    <ul>
        <li>Three free throws are awarded if the player is fouled while shooting for a three-point goal and they miss their shot. If a player is fouled while shooting a three-point shot and makes it anyway, he is awarded one free throw. Thus, he could score four points on the play.</li>
        <li>Inbounds. If fouled while not shooting, the ball is given to the team the foul was committed upon. They get the ball at the nearest side or baseline, out of bounds, and have 5 seconds to pass the ball onto the court.</li>
        <li>One & one. If the team committing the foul has seven or more fouls in the game, then the player who was fouled is awarded one free throw. If he makes his first shot, then he is awarded another free throw.</li>
        <li>Ten or more fouls(Varies from different levels). If the team committing the foul has ten or more fouls, then the fouled player receives two free throws.</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
        <dt>Charging:</dt>
        <dd>An offensive foul that is committed when a player pushes or runs over a defensive player. The ball is given to the team that the foul was committed upon.</dd>
        <dt>Blocking:</dt>
        <dd>Blocking is illegal personal contact resulting from a defender not establishing position in time to prevent an opponent's drive to the basket.</dd>
        <dt>Flagrant Foul:</dt>
        <dd>Violent contact with an opponent. This includes hitting, kicking, and punching. This type of foul results in free throws plus the offense retaining possession of the ball after the free throws.</dd>
        <dt>Intentional Foul:</dt>
        <dd>When a player makes physical contact with another player with no reasonable effort to steal the ball. It is a judgment call for the officials.</dd>
        <dt>Technical Foul:</dt>
        <dd>Technical foul. A player or a coach can commit this type of foul. It does not involve player contact or the ball but is instead about the 'manners' of the game. Foul language, obscenity, obscene gestures, and even arguing can be considered a technical foul, as can technical details regarding filling in the scorebook improperly or dunking during warm-ups.</dd>
        <dt><em>Violations</em></dt>
        <dt>Walking/Traveling:</dt>
        <dd>Taking more than 'a step and a half' without dribbling the ball is traveling. Moving your pivot foot once you've stopped dribbling is traveling.</dd>
        <dt>Carrying/Palming:</dt>
        <dd>When a player dribbles the ball with his hand too far to the side of or, sometimes, even under the ball.</dd>
        <dt>Double Dribble:</dt>
        <dd>Dribbling the ball with both hands on the ball at the same time or picking up the dribble and then dribbling again is a double dribble.</dd>
        <dt>Held Ball:</dt>
        <dd>Occasionally, two or more opposing players will gain possession of the ball at the same time. In order to avoid a prolonged and/or violent tussle, the referee stops the action and awards the ball to one team or the other on a rotating basis.</dd>
        <dt>Goaltending:</dt>
        <dd>If a defensive player interferes with a shot while it's on the way down toward the basket, while it's on the way up toward the basket after having touched the backboard, or while it's in the cylinder above the rim, it's goaltending and the shot counts. If committed by an offensive player, it's a violation and the ball is awarded to the opposing team for a throw-in.</dd>
        <dt>Backcourt Violation:</dt>
        <dd>Once the offense has brought the ball across the mid-court line, they cannot go back across the line during possession. If they do, the ball is awarded to the other team to pass inbounds.</dd>
        <dt>Time Restrictions:</dt>
        <dd>A player passing the ball inbounds has five seconds to pass the ball. If he does not, then the ball is awarded to the other team. Other time restrictions include the rule that a player cannot have the ball for more than five seconds when being closely guarded and, in some states and levels, shot-clock restrictions requiring a team to attempt a shot within a given time frame.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><strong>Player Postitions:</strong></p>
    <p>Center:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Centers are generally your tallest players. They generally are positioned near the basket.</li>
        <li>Offensive -- The center's goal is to get open for a pass and to shoot. They are also responsible for blocking defenders, known as picking or screening, to open other players up for driving to the basket for a goal. Centers are expected to get some offensive rebounds and put-backs.</li>
        <li>Defensive -- On defense, the center's main responsibility is to keep opponents from shooting by blocking shots and passes in the key area. They also are expected to get a lot of rebounds because they're taller.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Forward:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your next tallest players will most likely be your forwards. While a forward may be called upon to play under the hoop, they may also be required to operate in the wings and corner areas.</li>
        <li>Offensive -- Forwards are responsible to get free for a pass, take outside shots, drive for goals, and rebound.</li>
        <li>Defensive -- Responsibilities include preventing drives to the goal and rebounding.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Guard:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These are potentially your shortest players and they should be really good at dribbling fast, seeing the court, and passing. It is their job to bring the ball down the court and set up offensive plays.</li>
        <li>Offensive -- Dribbling, passing, and setting up offensive plays are a guard's main responsibilities. They also need to be able to drive to the basket and to shoot from the perimeter.</li>
        <li>Defensive -- On defense, a guard is responsible for stealing passes, contesting shots, preventing drives to the hoop, and for boxing out.</li>
    </ul>
